    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 07, 2026</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>WhatsCleaner</strong> (“the App”) handles user data.
        WhatsCleaner is a utility app designed to help users manage and clean WhatsApp and
        WhatsApp Business media files stored locally on their device.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong><br>
        WhatsCleaner does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information
        such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, or contacts.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Media Files:</strong><br>
        The App accesses WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business media files only after explicit user
        permission is granted through Android’s Storage Access Framework (SAF). Access is limited
        strictly to folders selected by the user. All processing occurs locally on the device, and
        media files are never uploaded or shared.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Folder Access (Storage Access Framework):</strong>
            Used to view, manage, and delete media files only within user-selected WhatsApp and
            WhatsApp Business folders.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Media Permissions (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_MEDIA_VIDEO):</strong>
            Used to display previews and thumbnails of selected media files.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Internet:</strong>
            Used only for essential app functionality such as loading libraries or non-personal content.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        WhatsCleaner may use Google Play Services, which operate under their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        WhatsCleaner does not store user data on external servers. Any media deletion is performed
        only upon user action and permanently removes the file from the device.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        WhatsCleaner is not intended for children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly
        collect personal data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
